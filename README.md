# Development Guide

To start up a development environment:

1. Ensure you have [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). 
2. Clone the project and run:

* ``` npm install ``` 
* ``` npm run build ```

3. Load the project directory as an unpacked chrome extension by:

- Going to ```chrome://extensions```
- Toggle on "developer mode" in the top right corner of the page
- Click the "Load unpacked" button on the top left and point to the directory you cloned in step 2.

4. If you are making ```.jsx``` changes, you can run the watch command to automatically convert your ```.jsx``` changes to loadable ```.js``` files:

- ```npm run watch```

The **entry point** for all voice commands is located in the background script [here](https://github.com/leekevinyg/edison/blob/master/background.js#L60).

Logging from extension side javascript is viewable by inspecting the ```background.html``` view from the extension entry under ```chrome://extensions```. Note that developer mode must be enabled.

For injected content scripts, logging is viewable by opening the regular developer tools on the webpage the content script was injected into.

Note, the extension currently utilizes a few external dependencies:

- Speech recognition with [annyang](https://github.com/TalAter/annyang).

- Fuzzy search powered by [fuse](https://fusejs.io/).

- Wakeword detection powered by [bumblebee](https://github.com/jaxcore/bumblebee-hotword).
